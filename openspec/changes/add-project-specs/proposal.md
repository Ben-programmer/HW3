## Why
The repository's `openspec/project.md` is currently a template. To enable consistent proposals and to make the project self-describing for contributors and automated validators, we should populate the project context and add a small change proposal that formalizes the `project` capability in OpenSpec.

## What Changes
- Add `changes/add-project-specs/` containing `proposal.md`, `tasks.md`, and `specs/project/spec.md` that ADDED the `project` capability describing project context fields and expectations.

## Impact
- Affected specs: `project` capability (new)
- Affected code: none (documentation/spec-only change)
- Risk: low â€” documentation/spec addition only
